This is the specification for the AbelianSandpile project.

There should be a representation for the ground and the grains of sand.
The ground should be a grid. It should know how many grains of sand exist in each cell.

Sand grains will be continuously added to an arbitrary cell on the ground. After reaching a specific threshold, the stack of sand should spill, sending its grains to adjacent cells.
