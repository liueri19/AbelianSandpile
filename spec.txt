This is the specification for the AbelianSandpile project.

There should be a representation for the ground and the grains of sand.
The ground should be a grid. It should know how many grains of sand exist in each cell.

Sand grains will be continuously added to an arbitrary cell on the ground. After reaching a specific threshold, the stack of sand should spill, sending its grains to adjacent cells.
After each grain of sand is added to the origin, the entire grid should be updated repeatedly to complete any chain effect.
